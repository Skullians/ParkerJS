The DiscordJS version of [parkervcp's ParkerTron (made in golang)](https://github.com/parkervcp/parkertron).

what's the purpose?
Hopefully incorporate some features that parkertron has not yet implemented (see their README).
will it be jankier? yep
This is for fun. Who knows? maybe someone decides to use it.
I might make docs on it later.
